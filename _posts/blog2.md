One day when Baba was seated on the raised platform under the bael tree, the teacher was visited by a pundit from the local school. This person had accumulated vast information from books and proceeded to lecture Baba on the shastras. Baba listened quietly. While the pundit was talking, a crow began making an unpleasant sound, which the pundit soon found intolerable. He threw a stone to make the crow fly away only to have the bird return immediately to the same branch. The crow resumed its noise making. The bird was freely expressing the beauty of its existence through its own sound. When for the second time the pundit attempted to drive it away, Baba interfered.

“You have driven away the crow because the sound seemed very unpleasant to your ears, but your sound, too, seems to me equally unpleasant and disturbing.”

The pundit was shocked. How could a crow and a human be considered on the same level? A crow is a crow and man is the master superior to all creatures.

However, to Baba each and every creation is itself the very manifestation of Divinity. He felt the same about the smallest ant as the highest being. For him, the possibility of the ego drawing a line of demarcation had totally disappeared. As a result, hate had no place in his heart.

The pundit heard only the physical hoarseness of the crow’s call and so its sound irritated him. But Baba saw the divine in the crow and heard the sound of divinity in it just as he saw the presence of the divine in the pundit. The all-merciful Baba loathed nothing.

Baba Lokenath was the teacher, the leader, the reformer of the highest order because all barriers of diversity had disappeared in him. He could only see good and do good. Through this episode with the pundit, Baba wanted to teach that nothing in this entire creation should be looked down upon. Each created thing in this world is great in itself.

By respecting others we only respect ourselves. The entire world is a mirror in which we see the reflections of our actions and thoughts. Love begets love.

Hate begets hate. Fear begets fear. We see the world, interpret the world, respond to the world, through the distilled essence of our own consciousness, and draw from the world that same essence.
